SINGLE PARENTS HEAD 25% OF FAMILIES IN U.S.,"  More than one-fourth of American families with children - and more than 60 percent of those that are black - were headed by a single parent last year, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.   A major factor is that women are having children and getting married later in life - or not marrying at all - and that marriages are more likely to end in divorce, according to Dr. Harriet P. McAdoo, a professor of social work at Howard University.   In addition, she said, there are a substantial number of out-of-wedlock pregnancies among both black and white women as the stigma of being an unwed mother lessens.","More than one-fourth of American families with children - and more than 60 percent of those that are black - were headed by a single parent last year, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/garden/single-parents-head-25-of-families-in-us.html

SCHOOLS STEREOTYPE CHILDREN WITH ONE PARENT,"  Despite a dramatic increase in the number of single-parent families in America during the last decade, a new survey suggests that the nation's schools continue to stigmatize them as abnormal - because of their family situations -not only in school policies and practices, but also in the attitudes of school personnel.   ''There's still a tremendous amount of negative stereotyping going on,'' said Dr. Phyllis L. Clay, who directed the survey of 1,200 single parents in 47 states. ''When teachers buy into these negative views, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy for the children.  It's even worse when parents accept these attitudes - and send messages to their kids that their family isn't as good as the family next door.''","Despite a dramatic increase in the number of single-parent families in America during the last decade, a new survey suggests that the nation's schools continue to stigmatize them as abnormal - because of their family situations -not only in school policies and practices, but also in the attitudes of school personnel.",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/02/style/schools-stereotype-children-with-one-parent.html
