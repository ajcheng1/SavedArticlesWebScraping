An easier way to search New York Times articles by keyword formatted in an excel format

Heavily inspired by this: https://medium.com/codex/web-scraping-the-new-york-times-articles-with-python-part-i-e2d6fc02d4e0

Sign up for an API key from this link: https://developer.nytimes.com/. You do not need a NYT subscription to get a key, but much recommended to read the actual articles!
